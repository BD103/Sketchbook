## 6-11-22

This is day 1 of working on Sketchbook. My plan is to develop this game for most of the summer. We'll see what ends up happening. :)

This game was originally made for a game jam, but my friends and I agreed that one week was not enough time. The deadline is postponed to the end of this summer, when school starts again. You can see my previous attempt [here](https://github.com/BD103/Sketchbook-Old).
